6. fetch with try/catch/finally block
7. custom spinner component for isLoading state
8. UseParams, using query strings, and UseSearchParams for navigation using state stored in the url.
9. UseNavigate for programmatic navigation. use to navigate to the form when the map is clicked on. And also to navigate back
10. Context Api. Creating a context folder with different contexts inside. Each context file will create its own context, have a context provider component, and custom useContext hook to return the values of its context.
11. Creating a map using react-leaflet. Also learned how to use the custom hooks that come with the react-leaflet plugin(useMapEvents, useMap)
12. used datePicker plugin
13. improved useContext component by handling state in a reducer function
14. handled CRUD functionality
15. fake authorization and protected routes component
16. lazy loading and using suspend api for routes
